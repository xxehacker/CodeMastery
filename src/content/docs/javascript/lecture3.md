### What is Type Casting ? 

In short: Type casting is the process of converting one data type to another.

Type Conversions in JavaScript refer to the automatic or explicit process of converting data from one data type to another in JavaScript. These conversions are essential for JavaScript to perform operations and comparisons effectively. JavaScript variables can contain the values of any data type as it is a weakly typed language.
There are two types of type conversion in JavaScript âˆ’
* Implicit type conversion (Type Coercion): This is when JavaScript automatically converts one data type to another. For example, when you add a number to a string, JavaScript will convert the number to a string and then concatenate them.
* Explicit type conversion (Type Casting): This is when the programmer manually converts one data type to another using functions like Number(), String(), or Boolean().

- `Implicit`
```javascript
let x = 10;
let y = "20";
let result = x + y; 
console.log(result);

let a = "100" + 24
console.log(a) // 124 : 10024
console.log(typeof(a)) //number : string
    
let a1 =   24 + 30 + "100"
console.log(a1)
console.log(typeof(a1)) 


let a2 =   "24" + 30 + 100
console.log(a2)
console.log(typeof(a2)) 

let a3 =   24 + "30" + 100
console.log(a3)
console.log(typeof(a3))
console.log(Number(a3)) 

```

- `Explicit`
```javascript
let x = 10;
let y = "20";
let result = x + Number(y); 
console.log(result); 


//  String to Interger Type casting
let age = "30"
console.log(typeof(age))
age = Number(age)
console.log(typeof(age))

// Interger Type casting to String
let age1 = 30
console.log(typeof(age1))
age1 = String(age1)
console.log(typeof(age1))

```


### Operators in JavaScript

Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. JavaScript provides various types of operators, including:

1. **Arithmetic Operators**: Used to perform mathematical operations.
2. **Assignment Operators**: Used to assign values to variables.
3. **Comparison Operators**: Used to compare values.
4. **Logical Operators**: Used to perform logical operations.
5. **Bitwise Operators**: Used to perform bitwise operations.
6. **String Operators**: Used to concatenate strings.
7. **Conditional (Ternary) Operator**: Used to perform conditional operations.
8. **Nullish Coalescing Operator**
9. **Spread Operator** 
10. **Rest operator** 

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numbers.

1. **Addition (+)**: Adds two numbers.
2. **Subtraction (-)**: Subtracts one number from another.
3. **Multiplication (*)**: Multiplies two numbers.
4. **Division (/)**: Divides one number by another.
5. **Modulus (%)**: Returns the remainder of a division.
6. **Exponentiation (**)**: Raises a number to the power of another number.

```javascript
let num1 = 10
let num2 = 20

console.log(num1+num2)
console.log(num1-num2)
console.log(num1*num2)
console.log(num1/num2)
console.log(num1%num2)
console.log(num1**num2)

// Increment
num1++
console.log(num1) // 11
// Decrement 
num1--
console.log(num1) // 10

for (let index = 0; index <= 10; index++) {
    console.log(index)
    
}
for (let index = 10; index >= 0; index--) {
    console.log(index)  
}
```

### Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

1. **Simple Assignment (=)**: Assigns a value to a variable.
2. **Addition Assignment (+=)**: Adds a value to a variable and assigns the result to the variable.
3. **Subtraction Assignment (-=)**: Subtracts a value from a variable and assigns the result to the variable.
4. **Multiplication Assignment (*=)**: Multiplies a variable by a value and assigns the result to the variable.
5. **Division Assignment (/=)**: Divides a variable by a value and assigns the result to the variable.
6. **Modulus Assignment (%=)**: Calculates the remainder of a division and assigns the result to the variable.
7. **Exponentiation Assignment (**=)**: Raises a variable to the power of a value and assigns the result to the variable.

```javascript
let num100 = 100;
num100 += 200
console.log(num100) 
num100 -= 200
console.log(num100) 
num100 *= 200
console.log(num100) 
num100 /= 200
console.log(num100) 
num100 %= 200
console.log(num100) 
num100 **= 2
console.log(num100) 
```

### Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare values.

1. **Equal (==)**: Checks if two values are equal.
2. **Strict Equal (===)**: Checks if two values are equal and of the same type.
3. **Not Equal (!=)**: Checks if two values are not equal.
4. **Strict Not Equal (!==)**: Checks if two values are not equal and not of the same type.
5. **Greater than (>)**: Checks if one value is greater than another.
6. **Less than (<)**: Checks if one value is less than another.
7. **Greater than or equal (>=)**: Checks if one value is greater than or equal to another.
8. **Less than or equal (<=)**: Checks if one value is less than or equal to another.

```javascript
let x = 10;
let y = 5;

console.log(x == y); // false
console.log(x === y); // false
console.log(x != y); // true
console.log(x !== y); // true
console.log(x > y); // true
console.log(x < y); // false
console.log(x >= y); // true
console.log(x <= y); // false
```

### Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to perform logical operations on values.

1. **Logical AND (&&)**: Returns true if both operands are true.
2. **Logical OR (||)**: Returns true if at least one operand is true.
3. **Logical NOT (!)**: Returns the opposite boolean value.

```javascript
let x = true;
let y = false;

console.log(x && y); // false
console.log(x || y); // true
console.log(!x); // false

let num10 = 10
let num20 = 20
//  && operator
console.log(num10>20 && num20<10) // false
console.log(num10>5 && num20<10) // false
console.log(num10>5 && num20>10) // true

//  || operator
console.log(num10>20 || num20<10) // false
console.log(num10>5 || num20<10)  // true

//  ! operator
console.log(num10 != 10)  // false
```

### Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators are used to perform bitwise operations on numbers.

1. **AND (&)**: Performs a bitwise AND operation.
2. **OR (|)**: Performs a bitwise OR operation.
3. **XOR (^)**: Performs a bitwise XOR operation.
4. **NOT (~)**: Performs a bitwise NOT operation.
5. **Left Shift (<<)**: Shifts bits to the left.
6. **Right Shift (>>)**: Shifts bits to the right.
7. **Unsigned Right Shift (>>>)**: Shifts bits to the right without sign extension.

```javascript
let x = 10; // 1010 in binary
let y = 5; // 0101 in binary

console.log(x & y); // 0 (0000)
console.log(x | y); // 15 (1111)
console.log(x ^ y); // 15 (1111)
console.log(~x); // -11 (1101 in two's complement)
console.log(x << 1); // 20 (10100)
console.log(x >> 1); // 5 (101)
console.log(x >>> 1); // 5 (101)
```

### String Operators

String operators are used to concatenate strings.

1. **Concatenation (+)**: Concatenates two strings.

```javascript
let str1 = "Hello";
let str2 = "World";

console.log(str1 + " " + str2); // Hello World
```

### Conditional (Ternary) Operator

The conditional (ternary) operator is used to perform conditional operations.
    
```javascript
let age = 18;
let canVote = age >= 18 ? "Yes" : "No";

console.log(canVote); // Yes

let str5 = "Hello world"
let str10 = "Bye world"
true ? console.log(str5)  : console.log(str10)  // true : Hello world 
false ? console.log(str5) : console.log(str10) // true : Bye world

```
### Nullish Coalescing Operator

The nullish coalescing operator is used to provide a default value if a variable is null or undefined.

```javascript
let x = 10;
let y = null;
let z = undefined;

console.log(x ?? y ?? z); // 10
console.log(y ?? x ?? z); // 10
console.log(z ?? x ?? y); // 10
```

### Spread Operator

The spread operator, also known as the spread syntax, is used to expand an array or an object into a new array or object. It is denoted by the ... symbol.

```javascript
// Example 1: Copying an array
const oldArray = [1, 2, 3];
const newArray = [...oldArray]; // [1, 2, 3]
console.log(newArray); // [1, 2, 3]

// Example 2: Merging objects
const oldObj = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const newObj = { ...oldObj, c: 3 }; // { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }
console.log(newObj); // { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }

// Example 3: Passing an array as arguments to a function

function myFunction(a, b, c) {
  console.log(a, b, c);
}
const args = [1, 2, 3];
myFunction(...args); // Output: 1 2 3
```

### Rest Operator

The rest operator, also denoted by the ... symbol, is used to collect the rest of the elements in an array or the rest of the properties in an object into a new array or object. 

```javascript
// Example 1: Collecting the rest of the elements in an array
function myFunction(a, b, ...rest) {
  console.log(a, b, rest);
}
myFunction(1, 2, 3, 4, 5); // Output: 1 2 [3, 4, 5]

// Example 2: Collecting the rest of the properties in an object
const myObject = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 };
const { a, b, ...rest } = myObject;
console.log(a, b, rest); // Output: 1 2 { c: 3, d: 4 }

// Example 3: Using rest operator in array destructuring
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const [a, b, ...rest] = arr;
console.log(a, b, rest); // Output: 1 2 [3, 4, 5]


```

### Type Casting Answers

##### Object to String
```sh
let obj1 = {name: "John", age: 20}
let obj2 = String(obj1)
console.log(obj2)
console.log(typeof(obj2))
```

##### Array to Object
```sh
let arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
let arr2 = Object(arr1)
console.log(arr2)
console.log(typeof(arr2))
```

##### String to Array
```sh
let str1 = "Hello World"
let str2 = str1.split("")
console.log(str2)
console.log(typeof(str2))
```

##### Array to String
```sh
let arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
let arr2 = arr1.join("")
console.log(arr2)
console.log(typeof(arr2))

let arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
let arr2 = arr1.toString()
console.log(arr2)
console.log(typeof(arr2))
```
